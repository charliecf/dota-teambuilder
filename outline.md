## User Perspective
**Inputs:**
- Overarching strategy
- I enter existing heroes and what lanes they are in

_Later:_
- Can set hero pool per player
    + Later reference hero pool from most played by steam ID
- 

**Outputs:**
- Hero combinations to pick for the remaining lanes

_Later:_
- Pick enemy heroes, so that the hero combinations takes into account the enemy heroes and potential counterpicks
- Picking order (based on hero tiers and opponents pick) --> make it work for captains draft or random draft modes

## Checklist of things to build:
1. Hero Tiers
2. Overall strategy
